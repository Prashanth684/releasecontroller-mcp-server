# ReleaseController MCP Server

Inspired by https://github.com/manusa/podman-mcp-server

This MCP server provides tools to interact with the OKD and Openshift release controllers to:
- provide details on release streams
- Latest accepted release in a release stream
- Latest rejected release in a release stream
- listing failed jobs in a release run
- identifying failures for a given job
