- provide the list of release streams and releases within the stream
- Latest accepted release in a release stream
- Latest rejected release in a release stream
- List failed jobs in a release run
- Identifying failures for a given job
- List CVE fixes in a given release
- List BUGS fixed in a given release
- List feature changes in a given release
